> 🧩 Built for **AlgoBharat HackSeries-2**, adhering to the *Three Judging Pillars* —  
> **Utility**, **Scalability**, and **Code Quality**.

---

## 🌐 Overview

**FairPass** revolutionizes event ticketing by transforming tickets into **traceable NFT assets (ASAs)** on the **Algorand blockchain**.  
It prevents scalping and fraud by making every ticket verifiable, immutable, and optionally non-transferable through on-chain role controls.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Event ticketing systems are plagued by:

- 🎫 Fake or duplicated tickets  

- 💰 Unauthorized resales (scalping)  

- ❌ Lack of transparent ownership validation  

FairPass eliminates these issues by **tokenizing tickets** as Algorand **ASAs** — giving both event organizers and attendees complete trust.

---

## 💡 Solution

FairPass leverages the **Algorand blockchain** to:

- ✅ Unique event tickets as ASA NFTs

- ✅ Anti-scalping controls via manager/freeze/clawback role locking

- ✅ Ownership verification via wallet and smart contract logic

- ✅ Real TestNet ASAs minted using Python SDK

- ⚙️ Mocked components for IPFS & DB to ensure smooth, key-safe demo runtime

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

FairPass consists of three primary layers — **Frontend**, **Application Logic**, and **Blockchain & Storage**.

![FairPass Architecture](docs/fairpass_architecture.jpg)

> *Users connect wallets, create events, mint NFT tickets, attach metadata via IPFS, and verify ownership through the Algorand system.*
>
> *Blockchain and storage operations are implemented using structured functional mocks for secure, predictable demo performance — maintaining real architecture flow without requiring live keys or network funds.*


## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Tools/Frameworks |
|-------|------------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS |
| **Blockchain** | Algorand SDK, PyTeal, TEAL, Python SDK |
| **Database** | Supabase *(mocked for demo)* |
| **Utilities** | `resend`, `axios`, `qrcode`, `date-fns` |
| **UI Components** | `shadcn/ui`, `radix-ui` |
| **Language** | TypeScript, JavaScript, Python |

## 🧩 Core Modules

### 🎟️ 1. Event Creation

- Simulates ASA minting for NFT-based tickets  

- Defines ticket metadata (name, seat, price)  

- Implemented in `src/app/create/page.tsx`  

### 🪪 2. IPFS Upload

- Mock route `/api/upload-to-ipfs` simulates pinning JSON metadata  

- Returns a demo **CID hash** for seamless runtime  

### 🔐 3. Wallet Integration

- Uses `@txnlab/use-wallet-react` to connect to **Algorand TestNet**  

- Demo Wallet preloaded via `wallet-loader.tsx`  

### 🧠 4. Smart Contract

- Implements transfer/ownership rules

- Role locking mechanism

- PyTeal source included in /contracts/pyteal

### 📲 5. QR Ticket Verification

- Generates and validates tickets using wallet address mapping

## 🔗 Real Algorand TestNet Assets (Minted)
FairPass includes live Algorand TestNet assets:

🎟️ ARC-3 Ticket NFT

Asset ID: 749632100
🔗 https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/asset/749632100

🎖 ARC-20 Loyalty Token

Asset ID: 749632546
🔗 https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/asset/749632546

>These are visible in Pera Wallet and are used during demo verification.

Some explorers may show “No references found” for new TestNet assets due to indexing delay.
The ASAs are successfully minted and visible in Pera TestNet wallet.

---

## 📁 Smart Contracts (PyTeal + TEAL)

Located in `contracts/pyteal/:`

- `ticket_checkin.py` – Validates entry + ownership
  
- `transfer_restriction.py` – Restricts unauthorized transfers
  
- Generated `.teal` files
  
- Additional contract documentation in contracts/pyteal/README.md
  
Deployment paused due to TestNet TEAL compiler downtime, but code is complete.

## 🔧 Python Minting Scripts (Real TestNet Integration)

Located in /scripts/:

- `mint_arc3.py` – ARC-3 NFT mint

- `mint_arc20.py` – Loyalty token mint

- `utils.py` – Algod client setup

- `fund_account.py` – Faucet helper

These scripts minted the two live assets above.

### 🔴 Mocked / Simulated Components
Used to safely represent blockchain, IPFS, and database operations **without exposing keys or using real funds**, while keeping the architecture intact.

| Component / File | Mocking Detail |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Blockchain Transactions** | ASA minting, transfers, and approvals simulated with mock Asset IDs. |
| `src/lib/algorand-utils.ts` | `checkAssetHolding` and NFT minting functions return predefined or random mock IDs. |
| `src/lib/certificate-minting.ts` | Skips live blockchain calls, returns mock Asset ID. |
| `src/app/api/upload-to-ipfs/route.ts` | Generates static demo IPFS hash (`QmVitaDemoHash…`) for metadata. |
| **Database (Supabase)** | Uses mock Supabase client for in-memory operations (non-persistent). |
| `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` | Displays mock ticket counts. |
| `src/app/mytickets/page.tsx` | Uses hardcoded mock ticket data (Asset ID 12345). |
| `src/app/ticket/view/[id]/page.tsx` | Simulates ticket metadata fetch and QR payload. |
| `src/app/api/welcome-nft/route.ts` | Updates a mock `welcome_nft_id` instead of minting. |

> 🧠 These mocks maintain accurate blockchain architecture while ensuring safe, consistent demo behavior for the hackathon.

### 🧭 Future Roadmap

- 🔗 Replace mocks with live Algorand TestNet transactions

- 🧱 Integrate with AlgoKit for contract deployment

- 📊 Add analytics dashboard for event organizers

- 🪶 Introduce fractional ownership for collaborative events  

- 🧾 Integrate PoAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) support
  
### 🤖 AI Collaboration Statement

🧠 “AI was used as a co-developer for scaffolding and documentation,
while all blockchain and logic layers were fully human-verified.”

This ensures compliance with AlgoBharat’s AI usage rule — AI as assistant, not architect.

### 🧩 Scalability Vision

FairPass is built as a modular access token engine, not just a ticketing system.
Potential future use cases include:

- 🎓 University passes and digital certificates

- 🏟️ Sports and season memberships

- 🎬 Concerts, conventions, and PoAPs

- 💼 Private club or subscription access NFTs
